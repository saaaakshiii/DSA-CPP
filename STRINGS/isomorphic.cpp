// Given two strings s1 and s2, check if these two strings are isomorphic to each other.
// If the characters in s1 can be changed to get s2, then two strings, s1 and s2, are isomorphic. 
// A character must be completely swapped out for another character while maintaining the order of the characters.
// A character may map to itself, but no two characters may map to the same character.
